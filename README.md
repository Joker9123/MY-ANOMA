These intents float freelyâ€”decentralized, open, and waiting.
But who catches them?

Thatâ€™s where the Solvers (fishermen) step in. ðŸŽ£
Their role: scan the sea, hook intents, and match them with others.

When two or more intents align, a transaction is born:
 Coffee delivered
 Assets swapped
 Ride shared
 Rules executed


 This creates a feedback loop of continuous market activity:
â†’ Users throw new intents in the sea.
â†’ Solvers catch & match them.
â†’ Fulfilled intents inspire new ones.
The cycle never stops. 

6/ Why does this matter?
Because Anoma redefines what a market can be.
Not just finance, but everything:

Coffee orders

Ride sharing

NFT swaps

Governance rules

Any coordination problem # MY-ANOMA
